Not much here yet....

compile with Arduino Leonardo board selected

TODO list
 * Lower the amount of spaced used on the chip (currently at 96%)
 * clean up code and add comments
 * update readme so that it's actually useful
 * add custom 'board' called Pikatea Macropad which is basically a duplicate of Arduino Leonardo
